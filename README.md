- If you afraid of removing items in mistake, by setting "lock" true, you can make the delete button hidden.

- By entering the image file's name in image table into "thumbnail", you can show the image at the beggining of the description easily.

The unit of the size of item is a size obtained by dividing your window size horizontally into 12 parts, 

and displayed size of items change dynamically when you change the size of the window.

1/12 is used for the margin between items, thus the upper limit of size is 11.

## Customizing design
If you want to custom the design of PhoenixCMS in more detail,

you can edit css files in ```home_page_local/assets/css```.

Note: the changes of css file are not reflected while running in prod mode. So, after change them, run the phoenix server in dev mode once.

### In more detail
Please rewrite html.eex files in ```home_page_dev/lib/home_page_web/templates```.

and

```bash
mix phx.gen.secret
```
The output is <secret_key_base>.

- `HOME_PAGE_MAIL_PASS=<your gmail account's password>`

- `HOME_PAGE_MAIL_USER_NAME=<your gmail address>`
  
After this, write your DB user name directly in dev.exs or prod.exs,please.
  
Finally,execute following codes to run the application.
```bash
export PORT=4000
MIX_ENV=prod<or dev> mix ecto.create
MIX_ENV=prod<or dev> mix ecto.migrate
MIX_ENV=prod<or dev> mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
MIX_ENV=prod<or dev> mix phx.server
```
If you are running on the local server, go http://localhost:4000 and can see.
